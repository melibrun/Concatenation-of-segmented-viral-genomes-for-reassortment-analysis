# Concatenation of segmented viral genomes for reassortment analysis
This [app](https://melibrun.shinyapps.io/combined_the_segments/) concatenate segmented viral genomes for reassortment analysis  
- input format file -> genbank  
- output format file -> fasta  
If you want to concatenate segments of a virus that does not consist of 8 segments, you need to enter the number of your segments in the field (Number of segments) and change the length of the segments according to the subtype of the virus. The remaining segments can be left untouched.  
If you want to have only protein-coding sequences in the final file, switch "Turn on if you want only protein-coding sequence".
